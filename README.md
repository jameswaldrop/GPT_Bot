This code sets up an interactive chatbot that uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user input. The code includes two versions of the chatbot: one that runs in the console using an infinite loop to prompt the user for input, and another that has a GUI interface using tkinter.

Both versions of the chatbot prompt the user for input, and if the user types "exit", the program ends. Otherwise, the code sends the user's question to the OpenAI API and prints the response generated by the API.

To use the console version of the chatbot, simply run the code in a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed and set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. The GUI version of the chatbot can be run by running the code in a Python environment with tkinter installed. The GUI provides an input field for the user to type in their question, a button to submit the question, and an output field to display the chatbot's response.
